# Learning from heuristics to improve safety of Deep Reinforcement Agents

This repository is the official implementation of my [bachelor thesis](https://).


## Requirements

For development I used Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 1.4.

I recommend to use the provided Conda environment config to install all requirements and the package itself.

```setup
conda env create -f env.yml -n safe_agents
conda run -n safe_agents pip install -e .
```


## Training


```train
(safe_agents) python scripts/runner.py train --help
Usage: runner.py train [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --env-name TEXT     Environment to run.  [default: LunarSafe-v0]
  --agent TEXT        Any of ['DQN', 'A2C', 'DQNControl', 'A2CControl',
                      'Baseline']  [required]

  --episodes INTEGER  Number of training episodes  [required]
  --save-loc TEXT     Path to save to after training  [default: ./models/]
  --help              Show this message and exit.

```

To train the model(s) in the paper, run these commands:

```train
(safe_agents) python scripts/runner.py train --agent DQN --episodes 300
```




## Evaluation

To evaluate the model(s), run this command:

```eval
(safe_agents) python scripts/runner.py evaluate --help
Usage: runner.py evaluate [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --env-name TEXT     Environment to run.  [default: LunarSafe-v0]
  --agent TEXT        Any of ['DQN', 'A2C', 'DQNControl', 'A2CControl',
                      'Baseline']  [required]

  --episodes INTEGER  Number of evaluation episodes  [required]
  --load-loc TEXT     Path to load saved agent  [default: ./models/]
  --help              Show this message and exit.

```

For example:

```train
(safe_agents) python scripts/runner.py evaluate --agent DQN --episodes 10
```


## Pre-trained Models

The pretrained models are stored in models. You can use them during evaluation.


## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
